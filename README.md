# DISTANCE-METER-BY-ARDUINO-UNO

IT IS IOT BASED PROJECT IN WHICH I USED THE ARDUINO UNO AS A MAIN MOTHER BOARD, HCSRO4 SENSER FOR MEASURING THE DISTANCE AND 16x2 LCD DISPLAY FOR DISPLAY THE DISTANCE
AND 10K POTENTIOMETER FOR ADJESTING THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LCD DISPLAY. 
IT IS A VERY EASY PROJECT WHICH YOU CAN USE AS FINAL YEAR PROJECT OR AS A MINI PROJECT TOO.
